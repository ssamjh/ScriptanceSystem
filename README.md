# ScriptanceSystem


How to setup.



1. Place templates for any dynamic servers in the templates folder respectively. (Servers are created in dynamic folder)
2. Place any files for static servers in the servers folder.
3. Setup the proxy in the proxy folder. Adjust the startPX-1.sh file if you use a proxy software that is different to BungeeCord.
4. Link the mc file in the bin folder to your /usr/bin folder. sudo ln -s /path/to/scriptance/bin/mc /usr/bin/mc
5. Run mc HB-1 to boot server HB-1. If this server already exists in dynamic it will be deleted and created again like any dynamic server system acts.
